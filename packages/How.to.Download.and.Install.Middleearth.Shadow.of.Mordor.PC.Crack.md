If you want to play Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor on your PC, you can download it from various online platforms such as Steam, GOG, or Amazon. However, if you want to play it for free, you will need to download a crack that bypasses the game's protection and allows you to run it without a valid license.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and install Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor PC crack from a reliable source. We will also provide some tips and warnings to ensure a smooth and safe gaming experience.
 
## Step 1: Download Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor PC Crack
 
The first step is to download the crack file for Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. There are many websites that claim to offer working cracks for various games, but not all of them are trustworthy. Some may contain viruses, malware, or unwanted programs that can harm your computer or steal your personal information.
 
One of the most reputable sources for game cracks is MegaGames[^1^], a website that has been providing game fixes, trainers, cheats, and mods since 1998. You can find the crack for Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor on this page[^1^]. The crack was created by Prophet, a group of skilled hackers who have cracked many popular games.
 
To download the crack, click on the "Download" button at the bottom of the page[^1^]. You will be redirected to another page where you will have to answer a simple question to prove that you are not a robot. After that, you will see a link to download the crack file. The file size is about 40 MB and it is compressed in a ZIP archive.
 
## Step 2: Install Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor PC Crack
 
The second step is to install the crack for Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Before you do that, you will need to have the game installed on your PC. You can either buy it from an official source or download it from a torrent site. However, we do not condone piracy and we recommend that you support the developers by purchasing the game legally.
 
Once you have the game installed on your PC, you will need to extract the crack file that you downloaded from MegaGames[^1^]. You can use any program that can open ZIP files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. After extracting the file, you will see a folder named "PROPHET" that contains several files and subfolders.
 
To install the crack, you will need to copy all the files and subfolders from the "PROPHET" folder and paste them into the game's installation directory. The default location for the game's installation directory is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ShadowOfMordor". If you installed the game in a different location, you will need to find it yourself.
 
After pasting the files and subfolders from the "PROPHET" folder into the game's installation directory, you will be asked to overwrite some existing files. Click on "Yes to All" to confirm. This will replace the original game files with the cracked ones.
 
## Step 3: Play Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor PC Crack
 
The final step is to play Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor PC crack. To launch the game, you will need to run the file named "ShadowOfMordor.exe" that is located in the game's installation directory. You can create a shortcut for this file on your desktop for easier access.
 
When you run the file, you will see a splash screen with the game's logo and then the main menu. From there, you can start a new game or load an existing one.

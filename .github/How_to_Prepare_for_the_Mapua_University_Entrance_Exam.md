The MSAE consists of four sections: English, Mathematics, Science, and Abstract Reasoning. Each section has 25 questions and a time limit of 30 minutes. The total duration of the exam is two hours. The MSAE is administered at the Mapua University campuses in Intramuros, Manila and Makati City. Applicants can choose their preferred date and time of examination when they apply online.
 
To prepare for the MSAE, applicants should review the topics covered by each section of the exam. According to some students who took the exam in 2018[^2^], the English section includes vocabulary, grammar, reading comprehension, and logical reasoning. The Mathematics section covers algebra, geometry, trigonometry, statistics, and word problems. The Science section tests the knowledge of biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science. The Abstract Reasoning section measures the ability to identify patterns, sequences, and relationships among shapes and figures.
 
One of the best ways to review for the MSAE is to use a reviewer that contains sample questions and answers similar to those in the actual exam. One such reviewer is the Mapua Institute of Technology Entrance Exam-25 questions file that can be downloaded from Clopified[^1^]. This file is a reviewer for incoming freshmen students that contains 25 questions from each section of the MSAE. It also provides explanations for each answer. However, this file is not the actual exam that applicants will encounter prior to their admission. It is only a guide to help them familiarize themselves with the format and content of the MSAE.
 
Another way to review for the MSAE is to watch online videos that share tips and experiences from students who took the exam before. One such video is Things to Review for Mapua Entrance Exam by Angel Egam on YouTube[^2^]. In this video, Egam shares some details about the different university entrance exams she took, including Adamson University, University of Santo Tomas, De La Salle University, University of Asia and Pacific, Ateneo de Manila University, and University of the Philippines. She also gives some advice on what topics to focus on for each section of the MSAE.
 
By using these resources and studying hard, applicants can increase their chances of passing the MSAE and getting into Mapua University. They should also remember to relax and be confident during the exam day. Good luck!
  
Aside from passing the MSAE, applicants must also meet other requirements to be admitted to Mapua University. These include submitting the following documents:
 
- Original and photocopy of Form 138 (Report Card) or Form 137 (Transcript of Records)
